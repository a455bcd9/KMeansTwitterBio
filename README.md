One of the problems I'm now facing with Twitter is how organize my friends (the users that i follow) in a way that I could easily read their posts based on similar interests or keywords. 

The idea is identify common groups of users and look at a segmentation based on user biography keywords. That biography information would allow us to segment Twitter users in groups of similar interests, professions and qualities.
